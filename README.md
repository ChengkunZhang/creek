# Creek Vector Processor

Creek is a vector floating-point co-processor implemented in Chisel.
It performs pipelined addition and multiplication on vectors of
single-precision floats.

Creek is a work in progress and is very incomplete. More documentation will
be made available once the project has progressed further.
